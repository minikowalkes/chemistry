There's nothing here yet. Give me a minute lol. <br>
<br>
I don't know how git works, and I don't know how open source works. <br>
I don't know if the GNU free software agreement actually legally protects me. <br>
If it doesn't, here's my own 'legality' warning; <br>
<br>
I'm not a programmer by trade. <br>
I'm not a chemist by trade. <br>
I do not make these programs for anybody other than myself, but you can copy 'em and use 'em. <br>
I have no money involved with this repository, so neither should you. <br>
<br>
These programs were created with the intent to make my life easier.<br>
These programs may or may not have the potential to brick a machine, so use them at your own risk. <br>
These programs were created without the use of ANY Artificial Intelligence. <br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes, this is a solo project. <br>
I will deny commits/pushes/whatever else from people who I do not know. <br>
