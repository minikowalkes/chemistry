There's nothing here yet. Give me a minute lol.

I don't know how git works, and I don't know how open source works.
I don't know if the GNU free software agreement actually legally protects me.
If it doesn't, here's my own 'legality' warning;

I'm not a programmer by trade.
I'm not a chemist by trade.
I do not make these programs for anybody other than myself, but you can copy 'em and use 'em.
I have no money involved with this repository, so neither should you.

These programs were created with the intent to make my life easier.
These programs may or may not have the potential to brick a machine, so use them at your own risk.
These programs were created without the use of ANY Artificial Intelligence.

For all intents and purposes, this is a solo project.
I will deny commits/pushes/whatever else from people who I do not know.

ROADMAP:
