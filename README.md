# Minikowalkes Chemistry Repository
<br>
<b>The purpose of this repo is to deal with chemical equations,<br>
up to the 200-level of college chemistry. You want organic? Look elsewhere.</b><br>
<br>
These programs were created with the intent to make my life easier.<br>
These programs also function to demonstrate my programming knowledge.<br>
These programs were created without the use of ANY Artificial Intelligence. <br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes, this is a solo project. <br>
<br>
<h2>Notes</h2><br>
-- OH MY GOD THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO IN PYTHON<br>
-- We're doin' it in java, babyyyyyyyyyyyyy<br>
-- You thought I'd abandoned this project!? THINK AGAIN<br>
-- Straight up need a new versioning schema, periods break a lot of platforms.<br>
-- HELLO, WE'RE BACK DEPARTMENT!? ID LIKE TO FILE A CLAIM.<br>
-- also we're going to go about this in the most convoluted way<br>
   by developing code in an IDE and then copy pasting like a damn<br>
   caveman, the way GOD INTENDED.<br>
<br>
<h2>ROADMAP:</h2><br>
uhhhh no idea.<br>
<br>
<strong>that's it for right now.</strong><br>
