# Minikowalkes Chemistry Repository
<br>
<b>The purpose of this repo is to deal with chemical equations,<br>
up to the 200-level of college chemistry. You want organic? Look elsewhere.</b>
<br>
These programs were created with the intent to make my life easier.<br>
These programs also function to demonstrate my programming knowledge.<br>
These programs were created without the use of ANY Artificial Intelligence. <br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes, this is a solo project. <br>
<br>
**Notes**<br>
-- OH MY GOD THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO IN PYTHON<br>
-- We're doin' it in java, babyyyyyyyyyyyyy<br>
-- You thought I'd abandoned this project!? THINK AGAIN<br>
-- Straight up need a new versioning schema, periods break a lot of platforms.<br>
<br>
