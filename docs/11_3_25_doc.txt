created class chemType

I'll add more when I'm not feeling ridiculously defeated.
Tried to make a derived class but failed miserably.

Thus far, all chemType is capable of is setting baloney.
And printing to the terminal... but oh well.
I'm just making the thing exist first.

TODO:

Better constructor signatures for more niche cases of obj instantiation
I gotta figure out why my derived moleType is pitching a fit

Also, gonna make src2/ electric boogaloo for JAVA which is the LANGUAGE
I ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO THIS PROJECT IN
but I was studying for a quiz... so this is the result of that.
