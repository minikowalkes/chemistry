I really should've separated my header files from
my source files. Oops.

Now I'm in too deep where I think it'll break things
if I try to separate em. or I may as well just add 
commented out headers in a separate directory...

Oh well.

Added moleType.h, moleType.cpp, and updated chemTypeTest.cpp
to reflect that IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!

moleType.h inherits methods present within chemType

TO DO:
Also will need ridiculous amounts of new function headers
for both constructors present within chemType and moleType.

Will need to add that struct of valid chemical names...
Boo-hoo. But I don't want to loop through it every time
an object is created of class chemType

What's the damn time complexity of checking the contents of
a struct?!?!?! How do I find that out!?!!?
