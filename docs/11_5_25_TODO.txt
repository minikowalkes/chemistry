It has come to my attention that I did not plan this
project at all, and I must completely refactor class
chemType in order to allow it to read and write to
and from files.

I've been avoiding file handling... but it is clear
to me that I can avoid it no longer!!!!!!!

Instead, I'll play bass and act like I'm studying
this thing that I really want to study, but won't.

TODO:

class fileHandler
+constructors(varying parameter lists, 
              will likely be small,
              no more than 3 params)
+readFile void&
+closeFile void&

#inputFile [attribute]
#outputFile [attribute]

-determineFileType const:string
-fileType [attribute]

class stringSplitter
// too lazy right now
